# Blackjack: Single Player Game (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
This project is a single-player Blackjack game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Features:
*** Players start with a chip amount (currently set at 200)
*** Players can draw new cards to try and reach a hand total closest to 21 without going bust (over 21)
*** Blackjack (21 on the first two cards) automatically wins
*** The game displays player information, cards dealt, hand sum, and game messages

# How to Play:
*** Open the index.html file in your web browser.
*** Click the "Start Game" button.
*** The game deals two cards to the player and displays the hand sum.
*** If the sum is less than 21, you can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (stay with your current hand).
*** Clicking "Hit" draws another card and updates the hand sum.
*** The game checks for Blackjack, bust, or if the player wants to draw another card.
*** The game ends when the player busts, reaches 21, or chooses to stand.
